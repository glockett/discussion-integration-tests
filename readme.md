Issues and Assumptions

Guardian user that is used for creating comments and replies must have 'Staff Member" privileges in order to complete 
the automated tests. This is so we get around the 1 minute limitation of only being able to add 1 comment per 
minute.

Staff Members cannot 'Pick a comment' their own comment.
